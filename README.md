# Preparation for the Spring 5 Certification 

This repository contains my code examples for the preparation of the certification.

The certification questions are based on the official [study-guide](https://d1fto35gcfffzn.cloudfront.net/academy/Spring-Professional-Certification-Study-Guide.pdf), so I recommend to focus on those questions. In my opinion, if you can easily respond to those questions, you will pass the certification.


To prepare my certification I read many books and articles, many Pluralsight courses and some Youtube videos on specific subjects.

To help you to prepare the certification, I recommend to learn from following resources, som are payed, but they deserve to be not free.



## The best resourse to follow
[Core Spring 5 Certification in Detail](https://leanpub.com/corespring5certificationindetail) by [Ivan Krizsan
](https://leanpub.com/u/ivan-krizsan)
This book should be a must for everyone.

## Books

[Spring 5 Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Design-Patterns-application-development/dp/1788299450/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ZRVPY8S85GBD&keywords=spring+design+patterns&qid=1570962674&sprefix=spring+design+pa%2Caps%2C216&sr=8-1) :

help you to understand how the Spring Framework is using some design patterns internally.


[Spring in Action: Covers Spring 4](https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Action-Covers-4/dp/161729120X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=spring+in+action&qid=1570962746&sr=8-2):

 I don't recommend the fifth edition, the 4th edition is a good start for everyone willing to understand the Fundamentals of the Framework, like Dependency Injection, Aspect Oriented Programming. It is not mandatory to read every chapter in the book.

[Spring Boot in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Boot-Action-Craig-Walls/dp/1617292540/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1570963413&refinements=p_27%3ACraig+Walls&s=books&sr=1-2&text=Craig+Walls):

 for a deepper understanding of Spring Boot.

## Youtube channel

[Laurentiu Spilca](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0z3MpVGrpSZzClXrYcZBfw):

 Laurentiu Spilca made a playlist on Spring Fundamentals, you will find very good content on DI,AOP,Transaction,Data,Rest,Actuator and many more...

[Melardev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1pRZW0dOIg&list=PLfkTJXI2Tk-cDvcd5pTnpHZXi-XgacpDG):

On his channel, Melardev explained the archirtecture of the Spring MVC module with deep understanding.

## Other ressources
[Git repository](https://github.com/vshemyako/spring-certification-5.0): This repository contains the responses of the question of the official study-guide.

[Git repository](https://github.com/LinnykOleh/Spring): This second repository contains the responses to the question of the official study-guide and also explanations of the theoretical notion we deal with in the Certification.

[Git repository](https://github.com/vojtechruz/spring-core-cert-notes-4.2): This third repository, even if it is about the spring 4 certification, you can find very good content and explanation about the spring ecosystem.

### Personal opinion

Sometimes even if the resources are valuable, it can be hard to understand some subjects, for my personal experience, i try to see the prerequisite of the hard subject.
It depends also on your background on Spring and some design patterns used by the framework.

In parallel with that, I read a lot of answers from stackoverflow. Just google what you don't understand.
