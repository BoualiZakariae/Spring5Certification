 * What is the concept of AOP? Which problem does it solve? What is a cross cutting
 * concern?
 * Name three typical cross cutting concerns.
 * What two problems arise if you don't solve a cross cutting concern via AOP?
 * See IOC question @todo.
 *
 * What is a pointcut, a joint point, an advise, an aspect, a weaving:
 *   a- An aspect is a class that implements the cross-cutting concern of an application.
 *   b- A joint point : apoint in the program execution where the aspec logic can be applied(method call for example).
 *   c- An advice is an aspect logic applied in a specific jointPoint.
 *   d- A pointcut is logical expression wich defines whether an advice should be applied in a specific joint point.
 *   e- A weaving is the process of combining the aspect with the business of the application.
 *      The weaving can be done at compile time, load time, or running time.
